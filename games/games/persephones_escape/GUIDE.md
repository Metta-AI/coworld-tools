# Persephone's Escape — Interface Guide

How to play the game using the 128x128 pixel client. See RULES.md for game rules and win conditions.

## Controls Overview

| Key | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Move | WASD / Arrows | D-pad |
| A (action) | J | A |
| B (info) | K | B |
| Select | L | Select |
| Chat | Enter | - |

## Game World

The main view shows your character in a top-down room with fog of war. A minimap in the top-right corner shows visible players as colored dots (you are always white).

### Bottom Bar

The bottom bar shows context-sensitive hints:

- **Default**: `J:NEW  K:JOIN  L:SHOUT` — your three main actions
- **Waiting for chatroom entry**: `WAITING...` with blinking unread dot if unread shouts exist
- **Leader in hostage select**: `L:COMMIT  </>:PICK  J:TOG`

### A Button — New Whisper

Press A to create a private chatroom at your position, or pull in a nearby free player. If you are too close to an existing whisper, the game warns `YOU'LL BE OVERHEARD`; move away before creating a new whisper.

### B Button — Join Whisper

Press B near an existing whisper to request entry. Press B again while waiting to cancel your request.

### Info Screen

The shared info screen is available from the shout/whisper tab cycle. This shows all players whose identity you know:

- **Full role revealed**: sprite + role indicator + role name in team color
- **Color only revealed**: sprite + team color dot + "???"
- **You** always appear first

If the list is longer than the screen, use up/down to scroll. A scroll indicator appears on the right edge. Press any button (A/B/Select) to close.

### Select Button — Shout

Press Select to open room shout chat (or commit hostage selections if you are the leader during hostage select phase).

## Private Chatrooms

When you create or enter a chatroom, your view switches to a full-screen chat interface. Your character stays in the world with a speech bubble indicator above it (visible to other players).

### Chatroom Layout

```
Top bar:    CHAT  [sprite][sprite]...     (participants)
Messages:   Colored dots = sender color
            * prefix = system messages
Entry req:  [!] [sprite] WANTS IN        (if someone is requesting)
Bottom bar: Action context (see below)
```

### Left/Right — View Tabs

Left/right cycle between the private whisper, room shout chat, and shared info screen. You remain in the whisper and cannot move while viewing shout or info.

### Select — Exit

Press Select to leave the chatroom and return to the game world.

### B Button — Action Menu

Press B to open the action menu. Navigate with left/right, press A to confirm, Select to cancel.

| Action | When Shown | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| C.OFFER | Not currently offering color | Offer to mutually reveal team colors |
| C.UNOFFR | Currently offering color | Withdraw your color exchange offer |
| C.ACCPT | Another occupant offered color | Accept a color offer — opens target picker |
| ROLE | Always | One-way: show your full role card to all occupants |
| R.OFFER | Not currently offering role | Offer mutual role exchange |
| R.UNOFFR | Currently offering role | Withdraw your role exchange offer |
| R.ACCPT | Another occupant offered role | Accept a role offer — opens target picker |
| PASS | You are the room leader | Offer leadership to the room |
| TAKE | Another occupant offered leadership | Accept leadership transfer |
| GRANT | Someone is requesting entry | Let the first requester into the chatroom |
| EXIT | Always | Leave the chatroom |

### Color Exchange (C.OFFER / C.ACCPT)

A safe first step to verify someone's team without revealing your role:

1. Player A selects **C.OFFER**. System message: "offers color"
2. Player B sees **C.ACCPT** appear in their action menu
3. Player B selects **C.ACCPT**, then picks Player A's sprite from the target picker (left/right to navigate, B to confirm, A to cancel)
4. Both players' team colors are revealed to each other. System message: "colors exchanged!"

Optional variant roles can bend this rule. A Spy shows the opposite team color
during color exchanges; a mutual role exchange is required to learn the Spy's
real team.

At match start, the intro screens list roles in play. Custom configs may omit
core roles; if an Echo role is active, the intro explains which missing role it
stands in for.

Either player can withdraw before acceptance by selecting **C.UNOFFR**. Offers are cleared when a player leaves the chatroom.

### Role Exchange (R.OFFER / R.ACCPT)

This is the core mechanic for the win condition. It requires consent from both players:

1. Player A selects **R.OFFER**. System message: "offers to share"
2. Player B sees **R.ACCPT** appear in their action menu
3. Player B selects **R.ACCPT**, then picks Player A's sprite from the target picker (left/right to navigate, B to confirm, A to cancel)
4. Both players' full roles are revealed to each other. System message: "roles exchanged!"

Either player can withdraw before acceptance by selecting **R.UNOFFR**. Offers are cleared when a player leaves the chatroom.

One-way reveals (ROLE) and color exchanges do NOT count for the win condition — only mutual role exchange does.

### Up/Down — Scroll Messages

Scroll through chat history with up/down.

### Enter — Type Message

Type a message visible to all current chatroom occupants. Only occupants present when a message is sent can see it.

## Shout Chat

A room-wide text chat accessible from the Select button, or from inside a whisper by cycling tabs with left/right.

### Layout

```
Top bar:    [ROOM NAME] CHAT
Messages:   Scrollable message history
Bottom bar: Usurp candidate selector (if non-leader)
            or hostage selector (if leader during hostage select)
```

### Select — Close

Press Select to close shout chat and return to the game world or whisper.

### A/B — Vote Usurp

If you are not the room leader, the bottom bar shows the current usurp candidate. Press B to cycle candidates (player sprites or NONE/ME), then press A to cast your vote.

### Left/Right — View Tabs

Left/right switches between shout chat and the shared info screen. If you are still in a whisper, it can also switch back to the whisper.

### Up/Down — Scroll Messages

Scroll through message history. You only see messages sent after you entered the room.

### Enter — Type Message

Send a message to everyone in your room.

## Phase-Specific Interfaces

### Role Reveal (game start)

A bordered screen showing your role, team, and room assignment with a countdown timer. Controls are listed on screen. Dismisses automatically when the timer expires.

### Hostage Select (end of each round)

- **Leaders**: Use left/right to move cursor across eligible players, A to toggle selection, Select (L) to commit. 15-second timeout auto-fills remaining picks.
- **Non-leaders**: See the leader's name and countdown timer. Can still access chatrooms and shout chat while waiting.

### Hostage Exchange

A brief cutscene (3 seconds) showing hostages being transferred between rooms. No input during this phase.

### Reveal (game end)

All roles are revealed. The winning team (or "NO ONE WINS") is displayed. Returns to lobby after a few seconds.
